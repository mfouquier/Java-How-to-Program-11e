Solutions to end of chapter exercises in Java How to Program 11th edition

## These projects are a collection of the assignments from two Java courses using the book Java How to Program 11th Edition

- Chapter 2 
  - Arithmetic -> take two user input integers and returns the sum, product, difference, and quotient.
  - Comparing Integers -> take two user input integers and compares to determine which is larger or if they are equal.
  - Circle -> takes user input radius of a circle and returns diameter, circumference, and area.

- Chapter 3
  - Date -> takes three integers and checks for they conform to month day year constraints and prints in the format MM/DD/YYYY.
  - Print Triangles -> prints various triangle shapes using * 
  - Parking Charges -> calculates parking charges based on number of hours parked. First 3 hours free and a max charge are considered.
 
 - Chapter 4
   - Credit Limit -> simulates a credit card with a credit limit and calculates debits and credits and prints balance.
   - Tabular Output -> creates a table of exponents using a while loop.
   - Triangle -> request 3 user inputs and determines whether the input make a valid triangle.
   - Bar Chart -> creates a simple bar chart using * based on user input.
  
 - Chapter 5 
   - Factorial -> prints out the factorial of a variable.
   - Pythagorean Triple -> prints out the Pythagorean triple. 
   - Smallest Integer -> take user input of 5 integers and returns the smallest input integer.
   - Value of Pi -> endlessly prints the value of Pi -> will have to check the point of this exercise to determine if program runs as expected.

- Chapter 6
  - Exponents -> takes user input for integer and exponent and returns the result -> 5^2 returns 25
  - Hypotenuse -> takes user input for 2 sides of a triangle and returns the hypotenuse.
  - Sets -> prints out a random even, odd, or 4's from randomly generated set of values.
  - Square Asterisks -> takes user integer input and then creates a square/rectangle based on that number using *

- Chapter 7
  - Dice Rolling -> simulates rolling two die 36,000,000 times and prints the frequency each value 2 - 12 was returned.
  - Fibonnaci -> takes user input and return the fibonacci sequence.
  - Liquids -> either uses a fixed or random array based on user response of user defined size. Generates the number of ounces then converts that to quarts. Then converts to gallons.
  - Two by Three -> performs various functions on a 2x3 array.
  - Sales Commisions -> calculates salary + commission calculations.
  - Exer 7 14 -> takes user input with a Ctrl-Z break then calculates the product of all integers submitted.
  - Exer 7 11 -> exercise to fill arrays with all 0's and fill with a given integer, etc.

- Chapter 8
   - Employee -> creates an Employee class to store names, salaries, and calculate salary raises.
   - Huge Integer -> takes user input and performs comparisons to a stored integer value.
   - Patterns -> takes user input and creates various patterns using *

- Chapter 9
  - Date -> prints dates in various formats -> U.S., European, etc. then compares two dates
  - Line of Code -> practice extending classes and using super
  - Quadrilateral -> extends multiple classes and calculates area of various shapes by extending and using super.

- Chapter 10
  - Shapes -> similar to Quadrilateral but breaks shapes into 2d and 3d then extends from there.

- Chapter 11 
  - Exceptions -> tests using exceptions to handle errors.

- Chapter 16
  - Time -> uses a Comparator and a Priority Queue to compare two Time objects

- Chapter 18
  - Recursive Power -> caluclates the power of an integer using recursion.

- Chapter 19
  - Bubble Sort -> exercise to demonstarte bubble sort.

- Chapter 20
  - Pair -> uses Generics and sorting

- Chapter 21 
  - Concatenate Lists -> uses LinkedList objects and concatenates them.
  - Reverse Sentance -> takes a user inputed line of text, prints the line split into its elements and then prints it in reverse. Uses Generics, stack, and pop.
  - Sorted List -> sorts a randomly generated list of integers.
  - Tree Depth -> uses the Tree class from the text and determines the depth of a tree of random values.

- Chapter 23
  - Bouncing Ball - creates a frame and generates random size and color circles when a mouse is clicked that move and bounce around the frame.

- Chapter 26 
  - Calculator -> creates a calculator gui with no functionality.
  - Coordinates -> compares array of coordinates and sorts them from low to high

- Chapter 27
  - Client Server Connect -> simulates a client server connection. Validates client username and password and presence of a file. Username and password in text file.
  - Grid Five -> creates a 5x5 grid in JFrame.

- JavaFX
  - BMI Calculator -> creates a JavaFX gui that calculates BMI.
  - Tip Calculator -> creates a JavaFX gui that calculates a tip based on total.
